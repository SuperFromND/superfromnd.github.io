        <h1>Temporary Notice!</h1>
        <p>Hello! Welcome to my very empty Github website.<br>You might notice there's nothing here... and that's because my main site is actually hosted over on Gitlab (since you can have a private repo that still deploys to a public website). However, as of this writing, Gitlab's Pages are currently such that every single URL I've posted to the site is broken, including what used to be a redirect to it on this page.<br>As such, I want to inform you that, for the time being anyways, all of my website's content must be accessed from <a href=https://superfromnd.gitlab.io/superfromnd.gitlab.io/>https://superfromnd.gitlab.io/superfromnd.gitlab.io/</a>.</p>
